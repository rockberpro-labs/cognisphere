# The repo's own, versioned copy of the guards: hooks/guard.sh copied to
# .agents/hooks/guard.sh and registered in .agents/settings.json, so they run for
# everyone on the repo whether or not they have the plugin. The flags are the checks
# the team turned off; they go on the hook's command line, where guard.sh reads them.
#   - The copy is the plugin's file: an older one is replaced ("updated"), and the diff
#     is the user's to review and commit like any other.
#   - A registration already in settings.json is the team's choice (its flags, or a
#     command they changed): it is never rewritten, and the flags are then ignored.
# --check writes nothing: one line for the copy (current, differs, missing), one for the
# registration (registered <command>, unregistered), and one per guard copy an older
# version left (old <path>).
# --project: a sub-project's own copy and registration (D38). Claude Code reads
# settings.json only from the folder a session starts in, so a session started there
# runs that copy, and $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR is that folder.
# Exit 0 done, 2 settings.json is not valid JSON (left untouched), 1 not a git repo or no
# such sub-project folder.
